# 3D-basic-math-library
Hi, buddy.
I have no any 3D knowledge except for some from drawing art. I design the basic math theory by my self, and verify it with the software. So you can see many strange concept, because I creat it by myselft.
Only the t3dimlib.cpp is usefult. I use Qtcreator to write the program. 
I also update the testapp , then you can run it directly.
For save your time, I will write a article in the code project site, which will introduce my idea, and guide to install ,
compile qtcreator application, please wait !
